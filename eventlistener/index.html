        <h2>EventTarget</h2>
        <p>The EventTarget interface is implemented by objects that can receive events and may have listeners for them. In other words, any target of events implements the three methods associated with this interface.</p>

        <h2>The addEventListener</h2>
        <p>The addEventListener() method of the EventTarget interface sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target. Common targets are Element, or its children, Document, and Window, but the target may be any object that supports events (such as XMLHttpRequest).</p>

        <h2>Event reference</h2>
        <p>Events are fired to notify code of "interesting changes" that may affect code execution. These can arise from user interactions such as using a mouse or resizing a window, changes in the state of the underlying environment (e.g. low battery or media events from the operating system), and other causes.
